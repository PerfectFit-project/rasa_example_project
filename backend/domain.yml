  utter_mood_bad_response:

  utter_purpose_1:
  - text: "Let me tell you a bit about myself next. My goal is to help people prepare for becoming more physically active."


  utter_purpose_2:
  - text: "Being more physically active is generally regarded as beneficial for both health and mood."


  utter_purpose_3:
  - text: "Well, we will create a plan together for when you will be exercising. Keep in mind that I won't ask you to do the exercises. We are only creating a plan."


  utter_purpose_4:
  - text: "I will, however, ask you to behave as if you really had to follow this plan to do physical activity."

  utter_purpose_5:
  - text: "And don't worry, we'll start off easy with planning some walks throughout the week."

  utter_purpose_6:
  - text: "Unlike leisurely walks though, you'll have to do them at moderate intensity. What that means is that you'll have to walk about 100 steps per minute."


  utter_purpose_7:
  - text: "Don't be alarmed if that seems a bit much right now. It will get easier after the first few times."

  utter_internal_moivation_1:
  - text: "The researchers already told me that you're quite motivated to do physical activity. "


  utter_internal_moivation_2:

  utter_explain_usefulness_planning_1:
  - text: "Now, I told you we'll make a plan together, but I forgot to mention why this is important to begin with."

  utter_explain_usefulness_planning_2:
  - text: "If you have a clear indication of when you should do an activity, it will be much easier for you to actually do it."

  utter_explain_usefulness_planning_3:
  - text: "You'll have a clear schedule set in place, which will make it a bit difficult to avoid doing exercise or to postpone it."

  utter_explain_usefulness_planning_4:
  - text: "After all, there is only so much time in a week."

  utter_routines_2:
  - text: "You don't have to provide me with your exact daily schedule, but let me know if you have any routines in place."

  utter_routines_3:
  - text: "For example, most people work a day job. But maybe you have things planned on some evenings as well."

  utter_routines_4:
  - text: "Ideally, we're looking for at least four different times during the week when you have at least 30 minutes to take a walk."
