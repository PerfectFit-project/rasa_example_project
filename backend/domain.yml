  utter_deal_with_barriers_9:
  - text: "If you lack the time to do physical activity, you could try taking a short walk when you have some free time (during your lunch break, for example)"

  utter_deal_with_barriers_10:
  - text: "In terms of energy, think back to when we talked about when you feel most energetic during the day. Aim to schedule activities at those times, since it will be easier for you that way."

  utter_deal_with_barriers_11:
  - text: "Try to go to the gym when it's a bit quieter if you don't like it when other people can see you doing physical activity. It is not absolutely necessary to go to a gym, especially if you're only taking walks. Try walking in a park nearby or simply on the sidewalk."

  utter_deal_with_barriers_12:
  - text: "Another common barrier is not having the right equipment. For walking in particular, the only thing you really need are shoes that are comfortable for you, so putting aside some money for that can be a relatively simple strategy."
